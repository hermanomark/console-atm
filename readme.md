## Console ATM

I challenge myself to build an atm in console with pin feature using only javascript.

You can copy the script to your chrome console and hit enter to run it.
- Default pin is "1234" you can generate yours:\
  Sample: atm.generatePin(2440);
- Check your balance (Input pin as arguement):\
  Sample: atm.balance(2440);
- Deposit an amount (1st arguement is pin and 2nd arguement is the amount):\
  Sample: atm.deposit(2440, 5000);
- Widthraw an amount (1st arguement is pin and 2nd arguement is the amount):\
  Sample: atm.withdraw(2440, 1000);
